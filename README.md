# dmosh

A serious, darkroom-inspired datamoshing editor shell built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, Framer Motion, and Lucide. Engine hooks are stubbed for now; the focus is on layout, motion, and interaction scaffolding.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` — start local dev server
- `npm run build` — type-check then build
- `npm run lint` — lint with ESLint
- `npm run test` — run Vitest unit tests
- `npm run test:e2e` — run Playwright smoke test against the dev server

## Deploy
Configured for GitHub Pages (`vite.config.ts` uses the repo base). A CI workflow builds and deploys from `work`.
